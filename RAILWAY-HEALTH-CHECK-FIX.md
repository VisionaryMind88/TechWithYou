# Fix Railway Health Check Issues

This guide provides solutions to common health check issues with Railway deployments.

## What's Changed

1. **Simplified Health Check Endpoint**
   - Changed to return a simple "OK" text response
   - No longer depends on database connections
   - Responds immediately for faster health checks

2. **Updated Railway Configuration**
   - Increased healthcheck timeout from 5s to 60s
   - Added 15s interval between health checks
   - Explicitly enabled health checks

## Manual Override Option

If you continue experiencing health check issues, you can try this manual approach:

1. In the Railway dashboard, go to your project settings
2. Under "Health Checks", there may be an option to disable health checks temporarily
3. Deploy your application
4. Once deployed successfully, re-enable health checks

## Testing Your Health Check

Before deploying to Railway, test your health check endpoint:

```bash
curl https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api/health
```

You should receive a simple "OK" response if it's working correctly.

## Additional Database Connection Tips

Since your application connects to a Supabase PostgreSQL database:

1. Make sure your Supabase database allows connections from all IPv4 addresses:
   - In Supabase dashboard → Database → Settings → Network
   - Enable "Allow from all IPv4 addresses" temporarily for testing

2. Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct in your Railway environment variables

3. Test the database connection separately from the health check using:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api/health/detailed
   ```

## After Deployment

Once deployed successfully:
1. Test all functionality of your application
2. Add your Railway domain to Firebase authorized domains
3. Consider restricting your Supabase database network settings for better security
