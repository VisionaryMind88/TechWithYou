# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common issues you might encounter when deploying your TechWithYou application to Railway and how to solve them.

## 1. Deployment Fails to Start

### Symptoms
- Deployment shows as "Failed" in Railway dashboard
- Application doesn't start
- Error in logs about missing environment variables

### Solutions
- Check that all required environment variables are set in Railway
- Verify the `start` command in railway.toml matches the script in package.json
- Check build logs for errors during the build process
- Ensure the PORT environment variable is set to 5000

## 2. Authentication Issues

### Symptoms
- Users can't log in on the deployed application
- Error messages about unauthorized domains
- OAuth callbacks failing
- Firebase authentication errors

### Solutions
- Add your Railway domain (e.g., `your-app-name.railway.app`) to Firebase authorized domains
- Update OAuth callback URLs in Google/GitHub settings
- Check that all Firebase environment variables are correctly set
- Verify CORS settings if using Firebase from browser

## 3. Database Connection Problems

### Symptoms
- Application starts but shows database errors
- "Connection refused" or "Connection timed out" errors
- "Authentication failed" errors for database access

### Solutions
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is correctly set in Railway
- Check if your Supabase PostgreSQL instance allows connections from Railway
- Temporarily disable IP restrictions in Supabase for testing
- Verify that the database user has proper permissions
- Check for database connection limits that might be exceeded

## 4. Missing Static Assets

### Symptoms
- CSS/JS not loading
- Images missing
- 404 errors for static files

### Solutions
- Ensure your build process is correctly configured
- Check that the build output directory is being served correctly
- Verify that the static file serving middleware is correctly configured
- Check for path issues in your asset references

## 5. API Endpoint Issues

### Symptoms
- API calls return 404 errors
- CORS errors when calling API endpoints
- Authentication failures on API routes

### Solutions
- Check API route definitions in server/routes.ts
- Ensure your Express server is properly set up
- Verify that any proxy settings are correctly configured
- Add appropriate CORS headers for your Railway domain

## 6. Firebase Storage Access Issues

### Symptoms
- File uploads fail
- Cannot retrieve files from Firebase Storage
- Permission denied errors

### Solutions
- Check Firebase Storage rules to ensure they allow access from your Railway domain
- Verify that Firebase environment variables are correctly set
- Check that the user authentication flow is working correctly
- Test file upload with small test files first

## 7. Performance Issues

### Symptoms
- Slow page loads
- Timeouts on API calls
- High CPU/memory usage

### Solutions
- Check Railway resource allocation for your deployment
- Look for database query optimization opportunities
- Ensure proper caching strategies are implemented
- Check for memory leaks in your application
- Consider scaling up your Railway instance

## 8. Deployment Succeeded but Application Not Accessible

### Symptoms
- Deployment shows as "Success" but the application is not accessible
- Browser shows "This site can't be reached"
- Railway health check failing

### Solutions
- Verify that your application is listening on PORT 5000
- Check that you're binding to "0.0.0.0" and not "localhost"
- Ensure the health check endpoint at `/api/health` is working
- Check for any firewall or network restrictions

## 9. Environment Variable Issues

### Symptoms
- "undefined" values in application
- Features not working as expected
- Authentication or API calls failing

### Solutions
- Double-check all environment variables in Railway dashboard
- Ensure variables are available at runtime (not just build time)
- Verify that environment variables are being properly accessed in code
- Check for typos in environment variable names

## 10. Railway-Specific Debugging

### Commands to Help Diagnose Issues

Check application logs in detail:
```
railway logs
```

Connect to your deployed service:
```
railway connect
```

Execute a command within your deployed environment:
```
railway run <command>
```

View environment variables:
```
railway vars
```

## 11. Recovery Strategies

If your deployment is broken and you need to recover quickly:

1. **Rollback to Previous Deployment**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to Deployments
   - Find the last working deployment
   - Click "Rollback to this deployment"

2. **Debug Mode Deployment**
   - Create a new environment in Railway for debugging
   - Deploy with additional debug environment variables
   - Test fixes in isolation before updating production

3. **Local Testing Before Deployment**
   - Set up a similar environment locally with the same environment variables
   - Test thoroughly before pushing changes to Railway
