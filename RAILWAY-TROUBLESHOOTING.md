# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Fixing Health Check Failures

The "Healthcheck failure" error you're seeing is a common issue when deploying to Railway. Here's how to fix it:

### Solution 1: Database Connection Issues

Railway's health check is failing because your application can't properly connect to the database. This might be because:

1. **Supabase Network Restrictions**: Your Supabase PostgreSQL database may be blocking connections from Railway's servers.

   **Fix**: In your Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to Database → Settings → Network
   - Enable "Allow from all IPv4" temporarily (for testing)
   - Once deployed successfully, you can restrict it to just Railway's IP ranges

2. **Database Connection Timeout**: The database connection might be timing out during deployment.

   **Fix**: We've already modified your code to make the health check simpler and not depend on database connectivity initially.

### Solution 2: Environment Variables

Make sure all required environment variables are correctly set in Railway:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_postgres_url
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

Plus all your Firebase configuration variables.

### Solution 3: Force Deployment without Health Checks

If you continue experiencing issues, you can try:

1. **Skip health checks temporarily**:
   - In your Railway dashboard, go to your project settings
   - Under "Health Checks", you might find an option to disable health checks temporarily
   - Once deployed successfully, re-enable health checks

2. **Check Railway logs**:
   - The detailed error message in the logs can provide more specific information
   - Look for database connection errors or port binding issues

## Specific Firebase and Database Configuration

1. **Verify your Supabase connection string**:
   - Ensure your DATABASE_URL is correctly formatted
   - Test the connection string locally before deploying

2. **Add Railway domain to Firebase**:
   - In Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
   - Add your Railway domain (e.g., web-production-9f664.up.railway.app)

## Final Steps

Once deployed:
1. Test all authentication flows
2. Verify database operations
3. Check file uploads
4. Test all application features
